My primary goal was to finish and launch at least one SAAS idea I had. The other goal was to consistently go to the gym 5 times a week and lift weights. Guess which one failed hard!\nMy main goal failed… I ended up losing $10,000 in cash and other forms of assets, with nothing to show for it. No launches, no presentable prototype, nada. I blame this failure on three things:\n1. Lack of Focus\nThe prototypes for my ideas could’ve been completed in less than 3 weeks. Instead, I spread myself thin by doing unpaid work for projects I co-owned, leaving me with almost no willpower and energy left for my personal projects. Just to add insult to injury, those co-owned project bets I took also failed.\n2 Not Knowing What’s Next\nI usually start strong when it comes to creating new things, but when faced with a specification or feature that I don’t know how to tackle, I end up lingering on it for a long time, eventually losing my momentum and drive.\n3 Dopamine Mismanagement\nThere were many times during my hiatus where I was so unmotivated and mentally tired that I couldn’t even do simple tasks for my project, like minor content and visual updates for my web projects. This was caused by my over-indulgence in short-form content, junk food, busy-work, worthless reading, random trips, etc. These things would fulfill my “dopamine” quota for the day, leaving me with not enough for the things I should be doing.\nDespite my failures with the former, I was very successful with my other goal. I managed to visit the gym consistently and lift weights, which ironically had more obstacles compared to my main goal, but I accomplished it. Five times a week for almost 6 months, with only a handful of misses along the way.\nSo what was the difference between the two? I’ve been trying to figure it out for months, but I think I could distill it into one thing—it’s Automation.\nAutomation means shutting my brain off, thinking less, and just doing more. My weightlifting journey was very automated. I’d get my workouts from my coach on a weekly basis, and then I’d just have to follow them. Easy and decisive. If I encountered an obstacle, I had enough willpower banked to quickly deal with it.\nI believe launching a product/startup/SAAS can also be automated in that way. I need to test for survivorship bias, but I believe that, just like card games (with a lot of variance), there are known statistically favorable actions you can repeatedly take when building, eventually leading up to success.\n",
