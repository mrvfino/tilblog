      <title>Day 9: Headless CMS Rabbit Hole</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the past few days looking for a headless CMS to include in the LaunchYourList.com template stack. To be honest, this would have been an easier task if I were just building this template for myself! However, since I plan to share it with non-tech friends who will have access to the code itself, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make it as painless as possible to setup and use.
Here are the options I have considered so far and my thoughts on each:</description>

      <title>Day 8: Spaces in Parent Dir Names Breaks NPM installs</title>

      <description>As the title says, I experienced this while trying to install an NPM package called better-sqlite3 to a project of mine that has a parent dir named with spaces.
You can find the Stack Overflow reference (here)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72806878/issue-installing-better-sqlite3-on-mac].</description>

      <title>Day 7: The `Protect` Move in Pokemon</title>
      <link>https://mrvfino.github.io/tilblog/docs/day7/</link>

      <description>Not a dev related post but, just keeping this info here as a reference for when I start developing games in the future.
Today I learned from this video that competitive Pokemon only exists thanks to the move called Protect.
It&amp;rsquo;s a simple and straightforward move, but it promotes a layer of complexity to competitive games by encouraging players to build strategies to counter and answer it, and in turn these strategies get their own counters as well, so and so forth until such time you&amp;rsquo;ll have something called a &amp;ldquo;meta&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Day 5: Devleoping Intuition for UIStackViews with CSS</title>
      <link>https://mrvfino.github.io/tilblog/docs/day5/</link>

      <description>Not really a new knowledge for me, but after getting a hang of flex from CSS it translated into me getting an improved intuition when using UIStackViews again in iOS.
One good example is that, you can have multiple constant legth views inside a stack view, but only one view with a dynamic length.</description>

      <title>Day 4: Terminal Has `whois` Built-in</title>
      <link>https://mrvfino.github.io/tilblog/docs/day4/</link>

      <guid>https://mrvfino.github.io/tilblog/docs/day4/</guid>
      <description>I just learned that Terminal has a built-in whois &amp;lt;domain&amp;gt; command that you can use to SAFELY check if a domain of your chosing is available online.
Why you may ask? Because sites like GoDaddy can allegedly front-run you in registering a domain you want when you look it up in their site.
FI stubmled upon this tidbit while brainstorming a domain name for my product, LaunchYourList.com - please check it out!</description>

      <title>Day 3: Use eight words or less</title>

      <description>Actually, I already learned this one last year, but re-learned it again while I was reviewing my 2023 journal prior to writing my plans this new year of 2024.
&amp;ldquo;Use eight words or less&amp;rdquo; basically means that when describing something (like Marvel Snap cards effects in this context) you should only use 8 words or less otherwise people won&amp;rsquo;t read it.
I learned this from Ben Brode&amp;rsquo;s GDC speech here.</description>
