I learned how to use [Spline](https://app.spline.design), a 3D design software, I was forced too because I was in a rush to create a hero image for my product, [LaunchYourList](https://launchyourlist.com).

It was fun and reminded me of the old days when I was fiddling with Warcraft's World Editor app.
