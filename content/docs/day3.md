Actually, I already learned this one last year, but re-learned it again while I was reviewing my 2023 journal prior to writing my plans this new year of 2024.

"Use eight words or less" basically means that when describing something (like Marvel Snap cards effects in this context) you should only use 8 words or less otherwise people won't read it.

I learned this from Ben Brode's GDC speech [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjhsY2Zuo-c).
