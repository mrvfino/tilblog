Not a dev related post but, just keeping this info here as a reference for when I start developing games in the future.

Today I learned from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dwocAz1A7M) that competitive Pokemon only exists thanks to the move called [Protect](<https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Protect_(move)>).

It's a simple and straightforward move, but it promotes a layer of complexity to competitive games by encouraging players to build strategies to counter and answer it, and in turn these strategies get their own counters as well, so and so forth until such time you'll have something called a "meta".
