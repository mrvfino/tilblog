During the infancy of YouTube, a clever internet hoax was made and spread by exploiting the channel redirect link feature of YouTube.

Removing the `h` from the `www.youtube.com/watch?v={VIDEO_ID}` will cause the rest of the query param to be ignored, in turn causing the link to become a channel link instead of a video link. The account/channel it redirects to has since been suspended. If you're all good with creepy stuff, look it up! It's a pretty intersting part of internet history.
