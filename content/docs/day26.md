During July last year, I took a personal hiatus and went to Manila, where I stayed for almost 6 months.

I had two major goals while I was there. My primary goal was to finish and launch at least one SAAS idea I had. The other goal was to consistently go to the gym 5 times a week and lift weights. Guess which one failed hard!

My main goal failed... I ended up losing $10,000 in cash and other forms of assets, with nothing to show for it. No launches, no presentable prototype, nada. I blame this failure on three things:

**1. Lack of Focus**

> The prototypes for my ideas could've been completed in less than 3 weeks. Instead, I spread myself thin by doing unpaid work for projects I co-owned, leaving me with almost no willpower and energy left for my personal projects. Just to add insult to injury, those co-owned project bets I took also failed.

**2 Not Knowing What's Next**

> I usually start strong when it comes to creating new things, but when faced with a specification or feature that I don't know how to tackle, I end up lingering on it for a long time, eventually losing my momentum and drive.

**3 Dopamine Mismanagement**

> There were many times during my hiatus where I was so unmotivated and mentally tired that I couldn't even do simple tasks for my project, like minor content and visual updates for my web projects. This was caused by my over-indulgence in short-form content, junk food, busy-work, worthless reading, random trips, etc. These things would fulfill my "dopamine" quota for the day, leaving me with not enough for the things I should be doing.

Despite my failures with the former, I was very successful with my other goal. I managed to visit the gym consistently and lift weights, which ironically had more obstacles compared to my main goal, but I accomplished it. Five times a week for almost 6 months, with only a handful of misses along the way.

**So what was the difference between the two? I've been trying to figure it out for months, but I think I could distill it into one thingâ€”it's Automation.**

Automation means shutting my brain off, thinking less, and just doing more. My weightlifting journey was very automated. I'd get my workouts from my coach on a weekly basis, and then I'd just have to follow them. Easy and decisive. If I encountered an obstacle, I had enough willpower banked to quickly deal with it.

I believe launching a product/startup/SAAS can also be automated in that way. I need to test for survivorship bias, but I believe that, just like card games (with a lot of variance), there are known statistically favorable actions you can repeatedly take when building, eventually leading up to success.
